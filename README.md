# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

**Background**
Credit card fraud is a significant issue faced by financial
institutions and customers worldwide. Fraudulent
transactions can lead to substantial financial losses and
undermine consumer trust in digital payment systems. With
the increasing volume and sophistication of fraudulent
activities, there is a pressing need for robust and efficient
detection mechanisms. Data science, particularly machine
learning, offers powerful tools to identify suspicious
transactions and reduce the incidence of fraud.

**Objective**
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine
learning model that accurately detects fraudulent credit card
transactions using a historical dataset. The model I developed is 
capable of distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent
transactions, minimizing false positives andfalse negatives to protect 
both customers and financial institutions.

**Dataset**
The dataset used, contains transactions made by European
cardholders in September 2013. It includes transactions that
occurred over two days, with 492 frauds out of 284,807
transactions, making the dataset highly unbalanced. The
positive class (frauds) accounts for only 0.172% of all
transactions.

The dataset is as follows:
